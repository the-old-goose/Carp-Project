# Carp-Project

I am currently working on a personal project I would like to keep disclosed which involves creating a web application (and eventually mobile integration) to track carp fishing statistics and provide useful information to anglers.

I am currently learnig C# ASP.NET Core MVC using entity framework to build the application and it is in very early stages of development.

The image below illustrates some ideas I have been toying around with.
